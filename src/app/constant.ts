- Suggest 2â€“3 simple, practical recommendations based on the analysis
Format your output as a JSON object with:
1. summary: A concise, readable paragraph summarising trends and projections
2. forecast: Monthly predictions for key metrics
3. charts: JSON-ready data series for plotting (e.g., for Recharts)
4. recommendations (array of strings): Actionable suggestions
5. issues: Anomalies or data quality concerns (if any)
